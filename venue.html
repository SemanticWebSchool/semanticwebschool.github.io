          ISWS is held in the University Residential Center located in the small medieval 
          hilltop town of Bertinoro. This town is in Emilia Romagna about 50km east of Bologna 
          at an elevation of 230m above sea level. It is easily reached by train and taxi from 
          Bologna and is close to many splendid Italian locations such as Ravenna, Rimini on the 
          Adriatic coast, and the Republic of San Marino (all within 35km) as well as some less 
          well-known locations like the thermal springs of Fratta Terme, the Pieve di San Donato 
          in Polenta and the castle and monastic gardens of Monte Maggio. Bertinoro can also be a 
          base for visiting some of the better-known Italian locations such as Padua, Ferrara, 
          Vicenza, Venice, Florence and Siena. <br />
          The city of Bertinoro itself is picturesque, with many narrow streets and walkways winding 
          around the central peak. Meetings are held in an archiepiscopal castle that has been converted 
          by the University of Bologna into a modern conference center with computing facilities and Internet 
          access. From the castle you can enjoy a beautiful vista that stretches from the Tuscan Apennines to 
          the Adriatic coast and the Alps over the Po Valley.  <br />
          The University Residential Center is located at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uSkBCjTMVhPbkuTU9"> Via Frangipane, 
          6</a> in Bertinoro (Telephone: +39 0543 446500 Fax: +39 0543 446599). <br />
          Bertinoro lies approximately half-way between Bologna and the Adriatic coast town of Rimini. Here is a 
          Google Earth place mark to locate the BiCi complex in Bertinoro. If you are arriving by car, you can 
          obtain driving instructions from most starting points using Google Maps.
