                      John Domingue is a full Professor of Computer Science at the Open University, Director of the Knowledge Media Institute, the OU’s technology Research and Innovation centre, and the President of STI International, a semantics focused networking organization. He has published over 280 refereed articles in the areas of semantics, the Web, distributed ledgers and eLearning. Prof. Domingue served as the leader of the first of five themes, on University Learners, for the £40M Institute of Coding which aimed to increase the number and diversity of computing graduates in the UK as well as enhancing the connection between university teaching and corporate training. In 2017 Prof Domingue’s research in blockchains and education was referenced in the Joint Research Centre Policy Report Blockchain in Education for the European Commission. Prof. Domingue has given many talks on his work including at the Royal Institution in 2018, at TEDx and most recently featured in THE Campus on interdisciplinary research teams. The start of 2022 saw a new project to develop smart national educational content platform (VocTeach Platform), embedding the latest AI techniques, to support FE educators was initiated with John Domingue serving as the overall project lead.

Her research activities cover two main trends: Human Computation (AI user acceptance, human-in-the-loop machine learning, user engagement for data management via citizen science and crowdsourcing) and Semantic Web (data fabric and data spaces, data harmonization and semantic interoperability), with focus on the application of such technologies to the development of web applications, especially in Smart City and Communities scenarios. She has 15+ years of experience in cooperative research projects, both at National/Regional level and at European level within FP6, FP7, H2020 and EIT (Digital, manufacturing, Urban Mobility). She is author of 100+ peer-reviewed scientific publications. With her team, she won the Semantic Web Challenge in 2011 and 2015, the AI Mashup Challenge in 2011 and the Big Data Challenge in 2014.

                      John Domingue is a full Professor of Computer Science at the Open University, Director of the Knowledge Media Institute, the OU’s technology Research and Innovation centre, and the President of STI International, a semantics focused networking organization. He has published over 280 refereed articles in the areas of semantics, the Web, distributed ledgers and eLearning. Prof. Domingue served as the leader of the first of five themes, on University Learners, for the £40M Institute of Coding which aimed to increase the number and diversity of computing graduates in the UK as well as enhancing the connection between university teaching and corporate training. In 2017 Prof Domingue’s research in blockchains and education was referenced in the Joint Research Centre Policy Report Blockchain in Education for the European Commission. Prof. Domingue has given many talks on his work including at the Royal Institution in 2018, at TEDx and most recently featured in THE Campus on interdisciplinary research teams. The start of 2022 saw a new project to develop smart national educational content platform (VocTeach Platform), embedding the latest AI techniques, to support FE educators was initiated with John Domingue serving as the overall project lead.
