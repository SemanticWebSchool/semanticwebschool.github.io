                      John Domingue is a full Professor of Computer Science at the Open University, Director of the Knowledge Media Institute, the OU’s technology Research and Innovation centre, and the President of STI International, a semantics focused networking organization. He has published over 280 refereed articles in the areas of semantics, the Web, distributed ledgers and eLearning. Prof. Domingue served as the leader of the first of five themes, on University Learners, for the £40M Institute of Coding which aimed to increase the number and diversity of computing graduates in the UK as well as enhancing the connection between university teaching and corporate training. In 2017 Prof Domingue’s research in blockchains and education was referenced in the Joint Research Centre Policy Report Blockchain in Education for the European Commission. Prof. Domingue has given many talks on his work including at the Royal Institution in 2018, at TEDx and most recently featured in THE Campus on interdisciplinary research teams. The start of 2022 saw a new project to develop smart national educational content platform (VocTeach Platform), embedding the latest AI techniques, to support FE educators was initiated with John Domingue serving as the overall project lead.

                      Paul Groth is Professor of Algorithmic Data Science at the University of Amsterdam where he leads the Intelligent Data Engineering Lab (INDElab). He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Southampton (2007) and has done research at the University of Southern California, the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and Elsevier Labs. His research focuses on intelligent systems for dealing with large amounts of diverse contextualized knowledge with a particular focus on web and science applications. This includes research in data provenance, data integration and knowledge sharing. Previously, Paul led the design of a number of large scale data integration and knowledge graph construction efforts in the biomedical domain. Paul was co-chair of the W3C Provenance Working Group that created a standard for provenance interchange. He has also contributed to the emergence of community initiatives to build a better scholarly ecosystem including altmetrics and the FAIR data principles. Paul is co-author of “Provenance: an Introduction to PROV” and “The Semantic Web Primer: 3rd Edition” as well as numerous academic articles.

                      Aidan Hogan is an Associate Professor at the Department of Computer Science, University of Chile, and an Associate Researcher at the Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data (IMFD). His research interests relate primarily to the Semantic Web, Databases and Information Extraction; he has published over one hundred peer-reviewed works on these topics. Within these areas, he particularly enjoys research on topics that bridge theory and practice. He has been invited as a tutor to eight summer schools and he has co-organised three summer schools. He is an author or lead author of three books, the latest of which, entitled “Knowledge Graphs”, is published with Morgan & Claypool, and is available for free online (https://kgbook.org/).
