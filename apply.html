          To participate in the regular selection process, you need to make sure 
          that you can cover your participation costs. Notice that the ISWS 
          registration fee (990 €) covers everything – lectures, accommodation, 
          meals and social activities – but the traveling costs, which are excluded. 
          The ISWS call for applications includes the possibility to apply for a grant, 
          in the situation that you can attend the school only with that support. Each 
          grant will only cover registration costs, meaning that applicants must cover 
          their traveling costs (train/flight tickets). We expect to have a very limited 
          number of grants, chances to get one is usually <10%. If you apply for a grant, 
          it means you can only participate in ISWS in the case of having a grant assigned. 
          By applying for a grant, you will enter a much more competitive process. Please 
          note that ISWS DOES NOT allow to move from the regular selection process to the 
          grant selection process and vice versa. This is because we want to make sure to 
          give grants only to students who would not be able to attend otherwise. On the 
          other hand, the student has also to renounce to participate in the school if the 
          grant is not assigned to her. <br />

    <p class="lead">
      All papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another
      journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:
      <br />

      <strong>Short Papers</strong> (5-9 pages including references) <br />
      <strong>Panel Proposals</strong> (2-3 pages, including references) <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p class="lead"><strong>Full papers</strong> are expected to showcase innovative and substantive research at the intersection of Digital Humanities and the Semantic Web, presenting results and evaluations. <strong>Short papers</strong> may share intermediate results, ongoing research, positions and ideas within these fields. We welcome any types of research, resource and application papers, as well as (short only) demonstration submissions. Both full and short papers will undergo review based on the following criteria: </p>
    <ul class="unorderedlist">
      <li>Relevance to the workshop</li>
      <li>Grounding in the literature and related work</li>
      <li>Originality and soundness</li>
      <li>Potential influence and significance</li>
      <li>Reproducibility and availability of resources</li>
      <li>Design and execution of evaluation (for full papers)</li> 
    </ul> 

  <p class="lead"><strong>Panel proposals</strong> should include a motivation of a highly relevant while controversial topic with suggestions for panellists and description of their expertise towards the topic. Panel proposals will be peer-reviewed, based on: </p>
  <ul class="unorderedlist">
    <li>Relevance to the workshop</li>
    <li>Grounding in the literature</li>
    <li>Potential significance and impact</li>
    <li>Clear presentation of controversial topics</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="lead">After the workshop, the authors of panel proposals will be given two additional pages to extend their abstracts with insights of the panel discussion for publication in the proceedings. </p>
