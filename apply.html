          To participate in the regular selection process, you need to make sure 
          that you can cover your participation costs. Notice that the ISWS 
          registration fee (990 €) covers everything – lectures, accommodation, 
          meals and social activities – but the traveling costs, which are excluded. 
          The ISWS call for applications includes the possibility to apply for a grant, 
          in the situation that you can attend the school only with that support. Each 
          grant will only cover registration costs, meaning that applicants must cover 
          their traveling costs (train/flight tickets). We expect to have a very limited 
          number of grants, chances to get one is usually less than 10%. If you apply for a grant, 
          it means you can only participate in ISWS in the case of having a grant assigned. 
          By applying for a grant, you will enter a much more competitive process. Please 
          note that ISWS DOES NOT allow to move from the regular selection process to the 
          grant selection process and vice versa. This is because we want to make sure to 
          give grants only to students who would not be able to attend otherwise. On the 
          other hand, the student has also to renounce to participate in the school if the 
          grant is not assigned to her.  <br />

          ISWS is not comparable to any other summer school. Students should keep in 
          mind that we will not consider applications from students or applicants 
          who cannot commit themselves to a full participation for the whole duration 
          of the school – i.e., it is a requirement for acceptance that applicants commit to
          <ul class="orderedlist">
          <li> arrive at the school by June 9th</li>
          <li> participate in all activities
          of the school during the week</li>
          <li> leave the venue not earlier than 1pm on
          Saturday, June 15th</li>
          </ul>
          Note also that students will share a room with one other student.<br />
          Apart from activities directly related to lectures, the summer school schedule features a 
          rich social programme, which enables informal interaction between all participants, i.e., 
          students, tutors, invited speakers, school staff, etc. These events include an afternoon at
          the swimming pool, a gala dinner, disco, and sport activities. <br />
